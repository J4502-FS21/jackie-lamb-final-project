      <p> &emsp; For your freshman year, it is advised that you plan to take J1100, J1200, J1300 and J1400. J1200 and J1300 should be taken your first semester so that you can take J1400 during the second. All three of these courses are project based; however J1400 is group projects while the other two are are either solo projects or partnered. J1100 is a lecture that pairs with all three classes so it does not matter which semester it is taken in.
      </p>
      <p> &emsp; J2000 can be taken at the same time as J1400 as long as J1100 has already been taken. The same goes for J4160 and J2200; however these two courses require having taken 30 credits previously so it is more likely and advised that you take it during your sophomore year. J4160 is a short class, only being 1 credit, and J2200 is 2 credits. </p>
      <p> &emsp; After J2200 has been taken, J1480 is available. If you want to pair this course with another Journalism class, I would suggest J1460 or J2000 if they have not been taken yet. For a 3 credit course, this class can be a lot of work with three large group projects that have the opportunity to get published. This course is also a four hour block so your schedule needs to be flexable round that time. Around this same time is when J3000 or J4556W can be taken, after both J1100 and J2000 with 45 credit hours already passed. You do not need to take both. </p>

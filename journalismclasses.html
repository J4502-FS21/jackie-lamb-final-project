      <p> J1100-J1400 are the core courses for the first year, give or take. J1200 and J1300 are required to have been taken and passed before J1400. Because of this, it is recommended that J1200 and J1300 are taken in your first semester. They are both project-based classes; however each project is relatively small and short so they work well together. J1100 is a lecture so it can also be taken during first semester, but don't view that as a necessity. J1400 has larger group projects. </p>
        <br>
      <p> J2000 can be taken at the same time as J1400 as long as J1100 has already been taken. The same goes for J4160 and J2200; however these two courses require having taken 30 credits previously. J4160 is a small class, only being 1 credit, and J2200 is 2 credits. They are good to take together. </p>
        <br>
      <p> After J2200 has been taken, J1480 is available. If you want to pair this course with another Journalism class, I would suggest J1460 or J2000 if they have not been taken yet. For a 3 credit course, this class can be a lot of work with the three large group projects that have the opportunity to get published. This course is also a four hour block so your schedule needs to be flexable round that time. Around this same time is when J3000 or J4556W can be taken, after both J1100 and J2000 with 45 credit hours already passed. You do not need to take both. </p>

      <p> J1100-J1400 are the core courses for the first year, give or take. J1200 and J1300 are required to have been taken and passed before J1400. Because of this, it is recommended that J1200 and J1300 are taken in your first semester. They are both project-based classes; however each project is relatively small and short so they work well together. J1100 is a lecture so it can also be taken during first semester, but don't view that as a necessity. J1400 has larger group projects. </p>
        <br>
      <p> J4160 is a shorter class with light work, hence it being only 1 credit. It can be taken with J1400 as long as J1100 has been completed already. This is similar with J2000, but this one is 3 credits so it will be more work.
